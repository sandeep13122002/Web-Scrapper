# Web-Scrapper
It is a web scraping project.

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves using a program or a script to access and gather information from web pages, 
typically in a format that is easy to work with, such as a spreadsheet or database. Web scraping is often used for various purposes, including data 
analysis, research, price comparison, monitoring websites for changes, and more.

The process of web scraping generally involves sending HTTP requests to a website, downloading the HTML content of the web pages, and then extracting 
the desired information from the HTML using parsing techniques. The extracted data can be stored in a structured format for further analysis or integration 
into other applications.

It's important to note that while web scraping itself is not illegal, there are ethical and legal considerations that need to be taken into account. Some
websites explicitly prohibit scraping in their terms of service, and scraping large amounts of data from a site too aggressively can put a strain on the website's 
servers, leading to performance issues. It's essential to review and comply with the terms of service of a website and be respectful of its resources when engaging 
in web scraping activities
